# CustomFileHeader
Custom file header is the comment area which developer gets by default while adding new file. 
How to change comment area in XCode

. Create a plist or property file with name IDETemplateMacros.plist
. For every text macro you want to customize, add a new key to the plistâ€™s dictionary. For example, to change the default file header, add an entry with the key FILEHEADER.
* Copy the file to one of the following locations. The directory specifies in which context the customized text macros should be applied:
* For a single project and user:
  * <ProjectName>.xcodeproj/xcuserdata/[username].xcuserdatad/IDETemplateMacros.plist
    * For all team members in a single project:
      * <ProjectName>.xcodeproj/xcshareddata/IDETemplateMacros.plist
    * For all projects in a workspace for a single user:
      * <WorkspaceName>.xcworkspace/xcuserdata/[username].xcuserdatad/IDETemplateMacros.plist
    * For all projects in a workspace for all team members:
      * <WorkspaceName>.xcworkspace/xcshareddata/IDETemplateMacros.plist
    * For everything you work on, regardless of project:
      * ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/IDETemplateMacros.plist

for new line in plist use option + enter
